Examples:
* Buttons
Start
ui.anim.start()
Stop
ui.anim.stop()
Reset
ui.reset()


* Slider
Speed
ui.model.speed = range.value
0 10 1 1

* Checkbox
Pause
checkbox.checked ? ui.anim.stop() : ui.anim.start()

* Dropdown
Shape
ui.view.drawOptions.turtlesShape = select.value
circle, dart, person, bug
bug

* Monitor
Ticks
ui.model.ticks


=======================================
ui.view.reset(value)
ui.view.downloadCanvas()
ui.view.drawOptions.turtlesSize = value
=======================================
To convert any of the view2/ demos:
Add: import * as UI from 'https://code.agentscript.org/uielements/uielements.js'
Set anim steps to -1
Add a bit of boiler plate:


=======================================
const sliderValue = range.value; // Gets the current value of the slider

const isChecked = checkbox.checked; // true or false

const dropdownValue = select.value; // Gets the selected value

range.value checkbox.checked select.value


ToDo
* Delete: Gets called via pass through?
* Show: Show/log() the form key/val pairs.
* Unified value: range.value, checkbox.checked, select.value => value

Fixed
* Text Highlighting: Stop dragging within text being selected (user-select css).
* Monitor: Remove command field, Monitor just need a variable/fcn to watch.
* Form Label: Replace "Initialize Element" with name of type: Button, Slider, ...
* Form Label: styled the name to be bold, centered, background gray



Oct 8: cleanup from chat json
- uielements.js
    - include window.ui object
    - fill window.ui with 3 exports: {cancel, showPopup, submitForm}
    - set window.ui.json to empty array
- uielements.html:
    - import './uielements.js';
    - add {model, view, anim} to window.ui object
    - add back ants model
- uielements.css:
    - styling for body & #modelDiv (used by ants model)
    - user-select: none;


Before we used an id: Date().getTime() so that deletions could work. Lets do that.
Also lets add the rest of the json entries for the given type.
Is there a reason to add an empty command entry for output elements? If not, lets leave it out.

The json is created properly and the elements are created, but the elements no longer work:
- delete with double click no longer creates an alert
- click on elements no longer run the command
- output elements no longer show the monitored values

It still doesn't work.
cliccking on a checkbox gives this error:
    uielements.js:367 Command failed: ReferenceError: checkbox is not defined
double click: only the placeholder works. for some reason e.ctrlKey fails.
(if i remove the placeholder check and do not use ctrlKey use, the delete dialog works)

Only json works:
1: element deletion does not work unless i remove the ctrlKey check.
2: commands do not execute
3: output monitoring does not work and does not show the text area for the value
4: json management works

button: ok
checkbox: ok
slider: doesn't work and label should be on top of slider
dropdown: doesn't work
monitor: doesn't work: label is "loading.." and shows ticks
