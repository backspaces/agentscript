Now it's time to actually run a simple model. We'll do it in two ways:

-   Locally: Using files on your desktop with your browser,
-   Web: Using a "sandbox" on the web, in this case CodePen.

I'm going to beg your patience here, there are a lot of details. We do this because many of us are new to HTML, browsers, servers and so on. And many of the details are core to browsers and servers.

## Run models locally

Running models locally is a bit odd: we've seen that we use an HTML file along with a separate Model JavaScript file. But HTML generally comes from a server. But it turns out that, by being careful (!), we can create a local HTML file and run it directly in the browser rather than using a server.

We'll downlode some files from AgentScript, and get them running locally so that we can modify them to better understand how to make your own models.

Start by creating a local folder to work with. We'll call it models/. I'm making mine in my home directory. You can create a folder with your system folders, or with the terminal:

Terminal:

-   cd # go to my home dir
-   mkdir models # make my models/ dir

System Folder:

-   Open a desktop folder and navigate to where you want the models/ folder to live.

Lets start with the usual [HelloModel.js](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/blob/master/models/HelloModel.js) and the [Views2/hello.html](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/blob/master/views2/hello.html) on the AgentScript github repo.

Click on both of these and click on the upper right download icon (downward arrow) for both. This places HelloModel.js and hello.html in your downloads folder.

Move these to your models/ folder. You can use the terminal:

-   cd to your downloads folder (In my home dir on my system .. cd ~/Downloads)
-   mv hello.html HelloModel.js ~/models

Or you can use your system folders:

Open two folders, Downloads and you models folder.

Drag and Drop the two files to your models folder.

Should look like:

And the two files like this:

Lets make sure it works. Make sure you have a browser running. Then do any of the following:

-   Drag and drop the hello.html file from your folder to the browser.
-   Double click on hello.html
-   From the models dir: open hello.html

The model should be running in the browser.

It will show a "file url" like this: file:///Users/owen/views1/hello.html which is a hint its somewhat special, and limiting.

OK, so far so good. Now lets modify/play with the two files. You'll need an editor. The best by far in the developer community is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). And you don't need to install it if you don't want to, you can [run it in your browser](https://vscode.dev/). We'll do that.

When you start vscode in the browser, it will ask you to "Open Folder". Click oon that and navigate to your models/ folder and select it. Your two files will show up like this.

Lets modify hello.html to use our local version of HelloModel.js.

Change "import Model from 'https://code.agentscript.org/models/HelloModel.js'"<br>
to "import Model from './HelloModel.js'" (which means use the local version)

It fails! Looking at the developer console we see:

Basically this runs into a limitation of local files.

But we can easily fix this.

First, remove ALL imports from both files! Then modify hello.html like so:

```html
<head>
    <title>hello</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/agentscript/dist/agentscript3d.umd.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        Object.assign(window, AS)
    </script>
    <script src="./HelloModel.js"></script>
</body>
```

And remove `export default HelloModel` from HelloModel.js
