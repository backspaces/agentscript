Now it's time to actually run a simple model. We'll do it in two ways:

-   Locally: Using files on your desktop with your browser,
-   Web: Using a "sandbox" on the web, in this case CodePen.

I'm going to beg your patience here, there are a lot of details. We do this because many of us are new to HTML, browsers, servers and so on. And many of the details are core to browsers and servers. Don't Panic!

But if you want to skip to the "answer", you can go to the [Summary](#summary)

## Run models locally

Running models locally is a bit odd: we've seen that we use an HTML file along with a separate Model JavaScript file. But HTML generally comes from a server. But it turns out that, by being careful (!), we can create a local HTML file and run it directly in the browser rather than using a server.

We'll downlode some files from AgentScript, and get them running locally so that we can modify them to better understand how to make your own models. And we'll use a fascinating browser based, zero install VSCode editor.

## Getting two files from AgentScript

We'll get a Model and a HTML file to run it. Start by creating a local folder to work with. We'll call it models/. I'm making mine in my home directory. You can create a folder with your system folders, or with the terminal:

Terminal:

-   cd # go to my home dir
-   mkdir models # make my models/ dir

System Folder:

-   Open a desktop folder and navigate to where you want the models/ folder to live.

Lets start with the usual [HelloModel.js](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/blob/master/models/HelloModel.js) and the [Views2/hello.html](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/blob/master/views2/hello.html) on the AgentScript github repo.

Click on both of these and click on the upper right download icon (downward arrow) for both. This places HelloModel.js and hello.html in your downloads folder.

## Moving the files to your dev folder

We can now move these to your models/ folder. You can use the terminal:

-   cd to your downloads folder (In my home dir on my system .. cd ~/Downloads)
-   mv hello.html HelloModel.js ~/models

Or you can use your system folders:

Open two folders, Downloads and you models folder.

Drag and Drop the two files to your models folder.

Should look like:

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/ModelsFolder.jpg)

And the two files like this:

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/ModelViewOriginal.jpg)

## Running the two files

Lets make sure it works. Make sure you have a browser running. Then do any of the following:

Running our model.html file:

-   Drag and drop the hello.html file from your folder to the browser.
-   Double click on hello.html
-   From the models dir command line: open hello.html

The model should be running in the browser, YaY!

It will show a "file url" like this: file:///Users/owen/views1/hello.html rather than the usual http:// url (which is a hint its somewhat special, although limiting.)

## Converrt to run locally.

OK, so far so good. Now lets modify/play with the two files. You'll need an editor. The best by far in the developer community is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). And you don't need to install it if you don't want to, you can [run it in your browser](https://vscode.dev/). We'll do that, its really amazing.

When you start vscode in the browser (type vscode.dev in the search area), it will ask you to "Open Folder". Click oon that and navigate to your models/ folder and select it. Your two files will show up like this.

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/VscodeDev.jpg)

Lets modify hello.html to use our local version of HelloModel.js.

Change `import Model from 'https://code.agentscript.org/models/HelloModel.js'`<br>
to `import Model from './HelloModel.js'` (which means use the local version)

Now run the model as before above. It fails! Looking at the developer console we see:

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/FileUrlFails.jpg)

Basically this runs into a limitation of local files.

## Fixing our files for local use.

But we can easily fix this.

First, remove ALL imports from both files and the `export default HelloModel` from HelloModel.js!

Then in hello.html replace:

```html
<head>
    <title>hello</title>
</head>
```

with:

```html
<head>
    <title>hello</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/agentscript/dist/agentscript.umd.js"></script>
    <script>
        Object.assign(window, AS)
    </script>
    <script src="./HelloModel.js"></script>
</head>
```

Then: replace

`const model = new Model()` with `const model = new HelloModel()`

and move `<div id="modelDiv"></div>` just after `<body>`

Remove:

-   `type="module"`
-   `await model.startup()`
-   `util.toWindow({ util, model, view, anim })`

Your two files will now look like:

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/ModelViewFinal.jpg)

So run the HTML file as before, and YaY it works.

## Review

All the modifications we made to the AgentScript files were required for running models locally rather than through a server.

Our approach started with the three script tags:

-   `<script src="https://unpkg.com/agentscript/dist/agentscript.umd.js">
</script>`
    fetched a "bundle" of all the AgentScript core code, replacing individual imports
-   `<script> Object.assign(window, AS) </script>` placed all the core into the global "window" object
-   `<script src="./HelloModel.js"></script>` brought in the HelloModel.js file.

The rest were moving from the module based files we started with to simpler scripts

## Summary

PLEASE do not worry about all these details!! What you mainly need is simple to follow along:

-   Downoad two files from AgentScript: a Model, and a html file running it.
-   Modify the AgentScript server oriented files to be simple "scripts".
-   .. by using vscode.dev (or similar) to modify them.

If you run into trouble, no worries, you can go to code.agentscript.org to get the starting files and the finished local deploy files:

-   [Initial files](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/tree/master/bin/localDeploy/modelsStart)
-   [Final files, above](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript/tree/master/bin/localDeploy/models)

## Modifying the model and html file

Now lets try making changes to model.html and HelloModel.js. Our setup is vscode.dev with the both files along their folder:

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/VscodeAndFolder.jpg)

Double click on hello.html to run in your topmost browser. After we make a change in vscode, save it and refresh the browser to see it.

In HelloModel.js:

-   Change the number of turtles: `population = 10 => 25`
-   Change the turtle speed to be twice as fast: `speed = 0.1 => 0.2`
-   Change the wiggle to be 20: `wiggleAngle = 10 => 20`
-   Remove the links: `//this.links.create(t, this.turtles.otherOneOf(t))`
-   Add links back and any of the above you'd like.

In HelloModel.js:

-   Change the steps from 500 to -1 (forever) `500 => -1`
-   Change the fps from 30 to 15 `30 => 15`
-   Change the patch size `from 20 to 40 to 10, and back to 20`

Now add draw options object to TwoDraw

        const view = new TwoDraw(model, {
            div: 'modelDiv',
            patchSize: 20,
            drawOptions: {
                // options go here
            }
        })

-   Inside drawOptions, change the turtle shape to "bug".

        drawOptions: {
            turtlesShape: 'bug',
        }

-   Change the turtle size by: turtlesSize: 2,
