Generally a model is deployed via a web server. AgentScript is deployed via github pages (which turns a repo into a server) and by publishing to [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/). Recently Content Delivery Networks have picked up the NPM deployments. AgentScript uses [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/)

We'll show how to use a special kind of web server, a [playground](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-javascript-playgrounds-every-developer-should-try/). We'll use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) in this tutorial but feel free to use one of the others.

## CodePen

Start by going to CodePen and creating a free account. It'll start out something like this:

## Create a Pen

Lets create our first Pen .. click on the "Go make one!" button or the Pen button on the top left sidebar. Click on Untitled and give your Pen a name. I'll use HelloView25. Save it.

## Add hello.html

We'll go to directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript) for our models rather than downloading as we did in LoocalDeplooy.

Lets start with the views25 folder. Click on it and then the hello.html file. Click on Raw, then paste the results in you Pen's HTML area

Paste that into your Pen's HTML pane. The model starts up right away! That's because our HTML imports the Model as well as the View. Notice I've minified the CSS panel by dragging it.

## Add HelloModel.js

Our next step is to put the Model code in our JS pane. On github navigate to our HelloModel.js by clicking on agentscript > modeels > HelloModel.js. Again click on Raw, then paste the results in you Pen's JS area.

## Modify hello.html to use local HelloModel.js

Finally we want to have the HTML pane point to the JS pane rather than importing from Github so that we can modify the Model and View, as we did in the LocalDeploy tutorial.

Each Pen has it's own url, showing in your browser's URL. Here it is: https://codepen.io/backspaces/pen/qBvwdEM (it may have an extension like ?editors=xxxx which we won't need.) Find yours and paste it into a new browser tab or window. It'll show a new instance of your Pen. This is great for sharing with others, just what servers are good at!

In your HTML pane, we'll replace the Model import with your URL above with a .js extension:

-   import Model from 'https://code.agentscript.org/models/HelloModel.js' =>
-   import Model from 'https://codepen.io/backspaces/pen/qBvwdEM.js'

One last change to our Pen, a Run button. Pens are outo-saved periodially, but we want to add a button to run when we change the Model or View. To do so:

-   Click on Settings (the gear icon)
-   Click on Behavior
-   Turn off Auto-Updating
-   Click Save & Close

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/CodePenRunBtn.jpg)

Oh and you can click on the button to the right of Settings to change the View. I'll place the panes on the left side. And widen the browser.

## Modify the HTML and JS panels

Lets test it: In the JS Pane, set population to 25, click Save then Run.

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

Lets start with our models/HelloModel.js as before. Click on models, then on HelloModel.js

![Image](/config/cleantheme/static/ModelsHello.jpg)

Click on the icon adjacent to the Raw button to get a copy, then paste it into the HTML section of your CodePen Pen. Click on the Pen's Save button.

In GitHub, click on "agentscript" to return to the top level, then on Views25 and then on "hello". Again click on Raw, then paste the results in you Pen's HTML area. Lets give our Pen a name: click on Untitled's pen and lets name it "Hello25".

Once
While we're at it, lets give our Pen a name: click on Untitled's pen and lets name it "Hello25". Click-drag the model to see it from verious views. Nortice that the turtles have a "z" value now.

But all this does is run the GitHub code remotely. Make on more change: Use the local version of HellooModel by changing the HTML import:

import Model from 'https://code.agentscript.org/models/HelloModel.js'

=>

import Model from './HelloModel.js'
