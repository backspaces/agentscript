Generally a model is deployed via a web server. AgentScript is deployed via github pages (which turns a repo into a server) and by publishing to [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/). Recently Content Delivery Networks have picked up the NPM deployments. AgentScript uses [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/)

We'll show using a special kind of web server, a [playground](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-javascript-playgrounds-every-developer-should-try/). We'll use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) in this tutorial but feel free to use one of the others.

## CodePen

Start by going to CodePen and creating a free account. It'll start out something like this:

Lets create our first Pen .. click on Go make one!

We'll go to directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript) for our models rather than downloading as we did in LoocalDeplooy. Lets start with our models/HelloModel.js as before. Click on models, then on HelloModel.js

Click on the icon adjacent to the Raw button to get a copy, then paste it into the JS section of your CodePen Pen. Click on the Pen's Save button.

In GitHub, click on "agentscript" to return to the top level, then on Views25 and then on "hello". Again click on Raw, then paste the results in you Pen's HTML area.
