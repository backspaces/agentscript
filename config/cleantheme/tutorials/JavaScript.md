history, having been introduced for the Netscape server in the mid 1990's.

There are _LOTS_ of resources for learning JavaScript. You can find several
books, too many to list here!

And there are several tutorials and videos to use, just google _javascript tutorial_ for them.

## JavaScript in 14 Minutes

One of the best for the absolute beginner is [JavaScript in 14 Minutes](https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes). It uses the browser's developer console. It will detect your OS and default browseer. I recommend Chrome but it supports them all.

is the _Source of All Truth_ for all things browser. The JavaScript section https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript is quite good, and you can search for any JavaScript primitive easily.
