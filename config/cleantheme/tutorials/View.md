<!-- # View -->

To "see" the model, we need the V in MVC .. the View. There are several views available, we'll use [TwoDraw.js](https://code.agentscript.org/src/TwoDraw.js)

You can see this in action with our [PheronomeModel](https://code.agentscript.org/views2/pheromone.html) and see the code via the [view-source capability](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000746.htm) discussed in the Model tutorial.

First, the Model does not change. Rather you add TwoDraw and augment the HTML.
